# Algorithms Library

A curated repository of **classic algorithm & data structure problems** implemented in Java.  
Ideal for learning, interview prep, or refreshing your understanding of fundamental algorithms.

## What’s Inside

- **Sorting & Searching** — QuickSort, MergeSort, Binary Search, etc.  
- **Data Structures** — Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Heaps, Hashing  
- **Graph Algorithms** — DFS, BFS, Shortest Paths, Topological Sort  
- **Dynamic Programming** — Knapsack, Longest Increasing Subsequence, Coin Change  
- **Greedy & Backtracking** — Scheduling, Subset Sum, Permutations  
- **Miscellaneous** — String algorithms, number theory, bit manipulation  

Each problem typically includes:
- Problem description
- One or more Java implementations (often “brute force,” optimized, or both)
- Unit tests (if available)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repo**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/damonx/algorithms.git
    cd algorithms
    ```

2. **Open in your IDE**  
   If you use IntelliJ, Eclipse, or VS Code, import as a standard Java project.

3. **Run / explore**  
   - Execute individual classes (with `main`) for demonstration  
   - Run test suites if included (e.g. using JUnit)  
   - Use as a reference for your own algorithm practice or learning

## Purpose & Vision

I created this repo to:

- Consolidate my personal solutions and experiment with different algorithmic patterns  
- Offer a reference library I can revisit when tackling new challenges  
- Share classic algorithm implementations with the community (learners, interviewers, peers)
